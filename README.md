# Quiz Notes!
This is an experiment/project I've started for my own personal note taking. I've realized that while writing down notes helps me memorize the material, I only retain the information for a short while. Revisiting the notes is difficult because reading is boring and by itself is bad at keeping retention.

Why not use Anki?
1. I like to solve my problems with my own software.
2. I don't like mixing questions from different courses (makes answers difficult to memorize when out of context + annoying).
3. I like to review questions when I want to and at my own pace. I personally found that spaced repition becomes too long, tedious, annoying, and yielding little benefit when it eventually just throws random questions out of random decks without any context. Memory requires context!
4. I don't have to learn how to write plugins. Just Javascript all my problems away! (That's an oxymoron but it works.)
