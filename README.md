**TODO:**
1) Types of questions should be supported:
    - Short answer elimination ("what's a sign of raf" "what's another sign of raf", etc...)
    - Select the meaning of a word through images/gif
    - Do i'rab with an on-screen keyboard

- [ ] Supporting printing webpage (low priority)
- [ ] Write a program that generates `questions.js` (low priority)

- [ ] Support for quiz mode (doesn't tell you the correct answers until the end)
- [ ] Show one question at a time, but add a skip button
- [ ] After question is complete, click hint to expand tries (if keyboard, all buttons are grayed out except rigth ones)
